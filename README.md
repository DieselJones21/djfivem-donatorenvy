# Envy Roleplay Donator (`djfivem-donatorenvy`)

FiveM donator store for **Envy Roleplay**, based on `djfivem-305donator`, with **Envy Coins**, Emerald / Sapphire / Black Diamond tiers, a neon cyan / chrome shop UI, Tebex console grants, oxmysql persistence, and Discord webhook logs.

Open with **F11** or `/donator`.

## Features

- **In-game shop editor** — admins add vehicles, weapons, extras, bundles, pets, exclusives, and limited drops from the Admin tab (image link, display name, ox item name, price, and the rest)
- **Empty catalog by default** — no built-in items; you add your own
- **Vehicles & weapons** — Emerald, Sapphire, and Black Diamond tiers, stored in **JG Advanced Garages** after purchase (ESX / QB / Qbox fallback if JG is not started)
- **Weapons & extras** — granted through **ox_inventory** (`CanCarryItem`, `AddItem`, `RemoveItem`)
- **Bundles** — one listing that grants multiple ox_inventory items in a single purchase
- **Color themes** — set only in `config.lua` (`envy` default: neon cyan + chrome). No in-UI theme picker.
- **Images** — shop UI and inventory icons from **Fivemanage** CDN links (`metadata.imageurl`)
- **City exclusives** — unique one-per-character vehicles, weapons, and access cards
- **Limited time** — server-enforced windows, stock counts, and countdown in the UI
- **Pets** — buy a companion ped, spawn / despawn it from ox_inventory
- **Envy Coins** — stored per character identifier, granted from chat, Tebex console commands, or the in-menu admin panel
- **Gifting** — buy an item for another player by server ID
- **Redeem codes** — admins can mint codes that grant coins and/or catalog items
- **Inventory + history** — owned items, 7-day spend chart, purchase log
- **Refunds** — admins can look up a player and refund a purchase
- **Discord logs** — purchases, coin grants, admin actions, and errors
- **Exports** — other resources (Tebex, VIP scripts) can grant coins

## Install

1. Put the folder in `resources` as **`djfivem-donatorenvy`** (the folder name must match — ox_inventory exports and `nui://` image paths use it).
2. Import [`sql/install.sql`](sql/install.sql) into the same database oxmysql uses. This script uses `dj_envydonator_*` tables (it does not share `dj-donator` or `dj_305donator_*` tables). The resource also creates the listings table on start.
3. Add to `server.cfg`:

```cfg
ensure oxmysql
ensure ox_inventory
ensure jg-advancedgarages
ensure djfivem-donatorenvy

add_ace group.admin donator.admin allow
```

`jg-advancedgarages` is optional. If it is not started, vehicles still insert into ESX `owned_vehicles` or QB `player_vehicles`.

4. Open [`config.lua`](config.lua) and set:
   - `Config.Images.baseUrl` to your Fivemanage folder URL
   - `Config.JGGarages.defaultGarage` to a JG garage **name** (example: `legion`)
   - `Config.Theme` (`envy`, `miami`, `rebel`, `crimson`, `ocean`, `gold`, `emerald`, `violet`) — config only
   - `Config.Webhooks` Discord URLs
5. Restart the server.

## Fivemanage images

Every catalog card and every ox_inventory grant can use a Fivemanage URL.

1. Upload images in the Fivemanage dashboard (vehicles, weapons, extras, bundles, pets).
2. Set the folder URL in `config.lua`:

```lua
Config.Images = {
    provider = 'fivemanage',
    baseUrl = 'https://r2.fivemanage.com/YOUR_TEAM_ID', -- no trailing slash
    extension = 'webp', -- or png
    urls = {
        -- optional per-key overrides
        -- sultan = 'https://r2.fivemanage.com/YOUR_TEAM_ID/sultan.webp',
    },
}
```

3. Name files after the spawn / ox item key:

| Kind | Example file |
|---|---|
| Vehicle | `sultan.webp` |
| Weapon | `weapon_pistol.webp` |
| Extra | `armour.webp`, `bandage.webp` |
| Pet | `pet_husky.webp` |
| Custom | `donator_plate.webp`, `penthouse_card.webp` |

You can also paste a full URL on any catalog row (`image = 'https://r2.fivemanage.com/...'`) or set `imageKey = 'armour'` when the listing id does not match the filename.

ox_inventory already allows `r2.fivemanage.com` and `i.fmfile.com` in `inventory:validhosts`. Grants set `metadata.imageurl` to the Fivemanage link so the item shows in inventory.

If `baseUrl` is empty, vehicles fall back to `docs.fivem.net` and items fall back to `nui://ox_inventory/web/images`.

## ox_inventory

This resource is linked to ox_inventory for **weight/slot checks**, **AddItem / RemoveItem**, and **usable pets**. Images come from Fivemanage first, then ox_inventory.

Put this above the donator resource:

```cfg
ensure oxmysql
ensure ox_inventory
ensure djfivem-donatorenvy
```

### Inventory actions

- Purchases call `CanCarryItem` before coins are taken
- Grants use `AddItem` (weapons include ammo metadata and `imageurl`)
- If AddItem fails, coins are refunded and any partial items are removed
- Admin refunds call `RemoveItem` for the same grants
- Pets are ox_inventory items (`pet_husky`, etc.). Using the item in inventory spawns or dismisses the pet

### Custom items

Merge [`install/ox_inventory_items.lua`](install/ox_inventory_items.lua) into `ox_inventory/data/items.lua`, then restart ox_inventory. That file registers:

- `donator_plate`, `penthouse_card`, `repairkit`
- Pet items with `client.export = 'djfivem-donatorenvy.usePet'`

Players open the store with **F11** or `/donator`. `/coins` prints the current Envy Coin balance.

## JG Advanced Garages

When `jg-advancedgarages` is started, a purchased vehicle is **stored** (not spawned):

- QB / Qbox: `player_vehicles` with `in_garage = 1`, `garage_id` / `garage` = configured garage, `state = 1`
- ESX: `owned_vehicles` with `in_garage = 1`, `garage_id` = configured garage, `stored = 1`

The player takes it out from that JG garage. Helicopters (`garageType = 'heli'`, e.g. Buzzard) map to JG `air` and auto-select a public air garage unless you set `Config.JGGarages.defaultGarages.air`.

`Config.JGGarages.defaultGarage` must match a garage **name** from JG (`exports['jg-advancedgarages']:getAllGarages()`), not the map label. Default example is `legion`.

Leave `jg-advancedgarages` as a soft dependency. Do not rename that resource.

## Admin

Admins are anyone with ACE `donator.admin`, ESX groups `admin` / `superadmin`, or QB / Qbox `god` / `admin`.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/givecoins [id] [amount] [reason]` | Add coins |
| `/removecoins [id] [amount] [reason]` | Remove coins |
| `/setcoins [id] [amount]` | Set an exact balance |
| `/checkcoins [id]` | Inspect a player (or yourself) |
| `/givecoinsid [identifier] [amount] [reason]` | Grant coins to an offline identifier (also used by Tebex) |
| `/envygrant [id or identifier] [amount] [reason]` | Tebex / console Envy Coin grant |
| `/envypackage [id or identifier] [itemId]` | Tebex / console catalog grant (no coin charge) |
| `/coins` | Show your own balance |

The **Admin** tab inside the store is where you add shop items, grant coins, create redeem codes, inspect history, and refund purchases.

### Add a shop listing in-game

1. Open the store with **F11** as an admin and open **Admin**.
2. Fill **Add shop listing**:
   - **Category** — Vehicle, Weapon, Extra item, Bundle, Pet, City exclusive, or Limited time
   - **Display name** — card title
   - **Price** — Envy Coins
   - **Tier** — Emerald, Sapphire, or Black Diamond (vehicles and weapons)
   - **Image link** — full Fivemanage URL (`https://r2.fivemanage.com/.../sultan.webp`)
   - **ox_inventory item name** — for weapons, extras, and pets (`armour`, `WEAPON_PISTOL`, `pet_husky`)
   - **Bundle items** — for bundles, add two or more ox_inventory names with counts (`armour` x5, `bandage` x10)
   - **Vehicle spawn name** — for cars (`sultan`)
   - **Item count**, **ammo**, **JG garage**, **pet model**, **unique**, **stock**, and limited dates as needed
3. Click **Save listing**. It shows in that shop tab immediately and is stored in `dj_envydonator_listings`.
4. Use **Edit** / **Delete** on the listings table to change or remove it.

Weapons and extras grant the ox_inventory item. Bundles grant every item in the package. Vehicles go into JG Advanced Garages. Pets grant an ox item whose name is the listing id (set Custom id to your ox item name).

Tabs are ordered Dashboard → Vehicles → Weapons → Extra Items → Bundles → Pets → City Exclusives → Limited Time → Inventory → Admin.

The default shop is empty on purpose so you only sell what you add.

## Catalog

Listings live in the database, not in Lua. [`shared/catalog.lua`](shared/catalog.lua) starts empty and is filled from `dj_envydonator_listings` when the resource starts.

## Discord webhooks

Set any of these in `config.lua`. Leave a field blank to skip that channel.

- `purchases` — buys and gifts
- `coins` — give / remove / set
- `admin` — codes, refunds, redeems
- `errors` — SQL / callback failures

## Exports

```lua
exports['djfivem-donatorenvy']:GetCoins(source)
exports['djfivem-donatorenvy']:AddCoins(source, amount, 'Tebex VIP')
exports['djfivem-donatorenvy']:AddCoinsIdentifier('license:abc123', 500, 'Tebex VIP')
exports['djfivem-donatorenvy']:GrantItemIdentifier('license:abc123', 'veh_sultan')
```

Amounts are server-validated (positive integers, capped by `Config.Tebex.MaxGrant`).

## Tebex

Tebex runs commands as the server console. Use either the identifier (`{sid}` / license) or the online server id (`{id}`).

**Give Envy Coins**

```
envygrant {sid} 2500 Tebex VIP
givecoinsid {sid} 2500 Tebex VIP
```

**Give a shop listing** (create the listing in Admin first, then use its Custom id)

```
envypackage {sid} veh_sultan
```

If the player is offline, coins still apply. Vehicles still insert into JG / framework garages. ox_inventory items wait until they next join (`pending` grant).

## Color themes

Set the default look in `config.lua`:

```lua
Config.Theme = 'envy' -- envy | miami | rebel | crimson | ocean | gold | emerald | violet
```

| Theme | Accent |
|---|---|
| `envy` | Envy Roleplay — neon cyan / chrome / black (default) |
| `miami` | Hot pink / cyan |
| `rebel` | Red / white / blue |
| `crimson` | Racing red |
| `ocean` | Cyan / blue |
| `gold` | Gold / black |
| `emerald` | Green |
| `violet` | Pink / purple |

Players cannot change this in the shop. Restart the resource after editing `Config.Theme`.

## UI preview

The NUI also runs in a browser for theme checks. From `html/`:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 4173
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:4173`. Preview mode uses sample data and does not talk to FiveM. Set `FM_BASE` in `html/app.js` `mockCatalog()` if you want the preview to load your Fivemanage folder.

## Notes

- Unique city exclusives and pets are one per character.
- Limited listings vanish when the timestamp passes, even if they are still in the Lua file.
- Pending inventory grants (offline gifts) are applied the next time that player loads.
- Offline vehicle gifts still insert into JG / framework garages.
- If JG is not running and your garage columns differ from default ESX `owned_vehicles` or QB `player_vehicles`, adjust `Framework.GiveVehicle` in [`server/framework.lua`](server/framework.lua).
